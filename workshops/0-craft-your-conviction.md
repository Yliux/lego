## 🎯 Objective

**Explore variations to confirm (or not) your problem understanding.**

## 🏗 Prerequisites

1. Create a Notion page called `Lego`.
2. Create a Figma project called `Lego`.

## 👩‍💻 Just tell me what to do

### Step 1. About the problem statement

**Write a tiny essay of - at least - 400 words of your own understading.**

Start naively with a first 100 word essay. Then 2 hours later, complete it with 200 words. 
After several sketching, you'll be able to write more than 400 words.

### Step 2. About [dealabs.com](https://www.dealabs.com/)

1. **Detail with screenshots: how [dealabs.com](https://www.dealabs.com/) works.**
    * What's a deal?
    * What could be the source of truth for our problem statement?
    * What could be our main key indicator for our problem solving 
    * Create several screenshots with zoom-ins/outs, explanation, items relation etc.
    * Use your Figma space for mindmaps, dynmism, several reading layers etc.

2. **List 3 sets that you think are a good starting point in our problem understanding**. Why?

### Step 3. About [vinted.fr](https://www.vinted.fr/)

1. **Detail with screenshots: how [vinted.fr](https://www.vinted.fr/) works.**
    * What's a sale?
    * What could be the source of truth for our problem statement?
    * What could be our main key indicator for our problem solving 
    * Create several screenshots with zoom-ins/outs, explanation, items relation etc.
    * Use your Figma space for mindmaps, dynmism, several reading layers etc.

2. What is the **connection between our 2 websites** to solve our problem statement ? 

### Step 4. Prototype and sketching

**Start sketching first variations to solve the problem statement.**

It should be done in black and white and in a simple way.

The required elements are:

* Buttons
* Fields
* Some identifying text (title,price, etc..)
* Placeholder for text, images, icons, logo
* Drop-down menu
* Including several variations
* Filtering and sorting
* Saving 

You can exclude elements such as color, typography, real icons, logo and pictures.

My recommendation is to

* **Draw layout structure with basic shapes** and lines to represent the layout structure of your wireframe. Start with simple rectangles to represent content. 

* **Add step by step basic content elements** to your wireframe, such as text boxes, buttons, images, or icons. Use simple shapes or placeholder text to represent these elements.

* **Stick to a black-and-white (remember paper and pen) color scheme** for your low-fidelity wireframe. This helps focus on the layout and structure without getting distracted by visual design elements. 

* **Avoid excessive and unnecessary details**. The purpose is to convey the layout, structure, and content hierarchy.
